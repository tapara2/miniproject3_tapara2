# MiniProject 3

Attached to this assignment are two files, one of them is a json file that contains synonyms and antonyms of the word optimistic as listed in [https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/optimistic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/optimistic) . The other file is a text file containing a copy of an article posted here:[https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/optimism-and-your-health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/optimism-and-your-health)

**Write a script to**

* Read the contents of both files (must use Promises when reading the text file)

* Count the number of times the words of each category were mentioned. E.g. when a word in the synonyms category is mentioned you increment the count for that category.

* Write the results in a file called result.txt (see the example results.txt file for the expected output)
